# Hospital Operations Analysis Dashboard — City General Hospital

**Author:** Loretta Chimezie

## Project Background 
City General Hospital is experiencing severe operational issues: ER overcrowding, bed 
misallocation, staff burnout, medication mismanagement, financial losses, and high lab retest 
rates. This project analyzes available hospital data and produces an interactive Excel dashboard 
with actionable recommendations.



## Project Objective 
1. Patient Demographics: Distribution of patients by Age groups, gender etc.
2. Admissions Trend: which day of the week is the busiest?
3. Billing & Insurance: Revenue generated by each insurance provider
4. Doctor Performance: Doctor to patient ratio - which doctors are working more and why?
5. Medication Utilization: How do we stop running out of essential drugs while others expire?
6. Admission Types: When do unexpected emergency spikes happen? 
7. Test Result Quality: Why are some of laboratory tests inconclusive?



## Datasets
- **City Hospital.xlsx** — patient id, age, gender, date of admission, department, billing amount



## Dashboard Features 
- Key KPIs: total patients, average age of patients, total income, average admission days, average income
- Visuals: time-series of visits, age-group distributions, staff workload heatmap, stock use 
chart, revenue breakdown, test result chart 
- Interactivity: slicers/filters for billing category, Date range, Age group, Medication condition type

---

## Key Findings (example) 
- Majority of ER visits are from elderly patients → contributes to bed shortages   
- Tuesdays and Thursdays have the highest number of patient visits
- Uneven staff distribution: some departments overloaded while others idle  
- Inventory mismatch: critical drugs short while others near expiry   
- 90% of lab tests flagged for retest, increasing workload and delays   
- Revenue leakage from unpaid insurance claims and billing gaps



## Recommendations 
1. Reallocate beds and triage protocols based on age-group trends   
2. Rebalance staff shifts using workload analytics and consider cross-training   
3. Implement automated stock monitoring & FIFO for medications   
4. Tighten lab QC processes to reduce retests (target <5%)   
5. Audit billing and implement a claims follow-up workflow to reduce unpaid claims   
6. Monitor KPIs weekly and run a monthly operational review with stakeholders



## Tools & Techniques 
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers)   
- Data cleaning and transformation in Excel   
- Dashboard layout and visualization best practices   
- Basic descriptive analytics and KPI design


## Project Files (included)
- `city hospital analysis.xlsx` — interactive dashboard file  
- `/dataset/` — raw data files used for analysis (xlsx)  
- `Presentation.pdf` — boardroom slide deck (9 slides)   
- `README.md` — this document


## How to Run / View 
1. Open `Dashboard.xlsx` in Excel (desktop recommended)   
2. Enable content (if prompted) to allow Pivot Tables and slicers to work   
3. Use slicers to filter by medical condition, Date, Age group, etc.   
4. Refer to `Presentation.pdf` for a summary of insights and recommended actions
